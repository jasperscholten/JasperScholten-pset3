**IMPROVED VERSION: https://github.com/jasperscholten/JasperScholten-Watchlist.git**

Watchlist app, with the ultimate goal of remembering what apps you still want to watch. In the current state, however, it only allows you to search for a movie, which details it then shows. These details include poster, title, director, actors and full plot. You can subsequenlty add it to your watchlist, and the app will remember this movie. However, when you add another movie, the first one will be removed from the list, resulting in still only one movie to watch.

Functions that still need to be implemented:
- Remembering multiple movies in watchlist.
- Deleting items from watchlist.
- Showing more details on click in watchlist.
- Showing posters in watchlist.

I came to the conclusion, that all of these functions can only be implemented after the implementation of saving multiple movies (through UserDefaults).
